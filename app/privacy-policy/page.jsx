                <h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>

                <p>{organizationLegal} secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or
                    disclosure. {organizationLegal} uses the following methods for this purpose:&nbsp;</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>&nbsp;SSL Protocol</li>
                </ul>

                <p>&nbsp;<br />
                    When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites,
                    it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
                    protocol.<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or
                    alteration of your personal information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
                    Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we
                    strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security
                    and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b)
                    security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you
                    and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed.<br />
