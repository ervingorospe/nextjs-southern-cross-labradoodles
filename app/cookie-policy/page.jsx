                <h2>What are cookies?</h2>

                <p>Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved on your computer or other
                  devices when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to remember you and your
                  preferences, either for a single visit (through a "session cookie") or for multiple
                  repeat visits (using a "persistent cookie").
                </p>

                <p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the
                  Website, and they expire when you close the web browser.
                </p>

                <p>Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within our Website and remain on your
                  desktop or mobile device even after you close your browser or restart your computer. They ensure
                  a consistent and efficient experience for you while visiting the Website and Services.
